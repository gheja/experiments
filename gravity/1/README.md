# A demo for gravitationally bound systems

## Notes on the configuration used for the Solar System

All distances and speeds noted here are at perihelion - at the point of
the orbit that is the closest to the Sun. The speed is the highest at
this point.

The distance and speed of the Moon (of Earth) is noted at perigee - the
closest point to Earth, although in reality the values vary by a few
percents.
